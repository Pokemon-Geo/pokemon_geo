# pokemon_geo

Pokemon Geo is our geo-tagging game built during HackaTUM 2022 (Huawei Challenge) based on OpenStreetMap and Mapillary.

In our app, the user is interacting with the real world by solving "issues". While taking a walk, the player can take photos, tackle time-based challenges, compete in an online leaderboard and much more. At the same time, this will help OpenStreetMap to improve their tags.

We hope you have fun playing our game and we wish you a wonderful day!

Gotta catch â€˜em issues.
